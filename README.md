## How to use
From the main page, there are three things you can do:
1. Make a new post
2. View your profile page

### Making a new post
To make a new post, select the New Post card on the main menu.
You can add three things to your post: text, a photo, and a video.

To add text, select the first card in the menu. This will let you speak, and will add the transcribed text to your post.
You can add either a photo or a video to your post (but not both). To do so, either use the camera button (short press for photo, long press for video) or select the card in the menu.
Finally, to post, select the rightmost card.
### Viewing a feed
When you open a feed, you'll see a list of posts. You can swipe through the posts, and tap to view one.

When viewing a post, you can swipe to the left for various options, such as liking the post, replying, or viewing the post author's page. If you swipe right, you can see the replies to the post.
